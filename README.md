The supplementary table, supplementary-table-alakorkko.xlsx, contains detailed information about the Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the HarvardOxford atlas that we used in the study. For the in-house dataset we used 96 ROIs and for the ABIDE dataset 92 ROIs. Besides name and size of each ROI, the table shows, for each ROI, degree, degree rank, eigenvector centrality, and probability to belong to the largest connected component (LCC) calculated when four different levels of spatial smoothing have been applied. For spatial smoothing, we used a Gaussian smoothing kernel with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 0 mm (i.e. no smoothing), 5 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm.
